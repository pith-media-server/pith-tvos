A British mining concern is convinced that their interests would be better served in a stable South Africa and they quietly dispatch Michael Young, their head of public affairs, to open an unofficial dialogue between the bitter rivals.  Assembling a reluctant yet brilliant team to pave the way to reconciliation by confronting obstacles that initially seem insurmountable, Young places his trust in ANC leader Thabo Mbeki and Afrikaner philosophy professor Willie Esterhuyse. It is their empathy that will ultimately serve as the catalyst for change by proving more powerful than the terrorist bombs that threaten to disrupt the peaceful dialogue.","rating":6.2,"imdbId":"tt1217616","tmdbId":15102,"playable":true,"file":"/movies/Endgame (2009)/Endgame.2009.720p.BluRay.DTS.x264-CRiSC.mkv","mimetype":"video/x-matroska"},{"id":"movie.470","title":"Enemy","type":"file","year":2013,"mediatype":"movie","banners":[],"posters":[{"url":"http://radarr.evinyatar.be/api/v3/mediacover/470/poster.jpg?apikey=b52eb9349dd749788b065ee64e4a5168"}],"backdrops":[{"url":"http://radarr.evinyatar.be/api/v3/mediacover/470/fanart.jpg?apikey=b52eb9349dd749788b065ee64e4a5168"}],"dateScanned":"2022-09-13T20:01:10.000Z","releaseDate":"2013-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","overview":"A mild-mannered college professor discovers a look-alike actor and delves into the other man's private affairs.","rating":6.9,"imdbId":"tt2316411","tmdbId":181886,"playable":true,"file":"/movies/Enemy (2014)/Enemy.2013.720p.WEB-DL.H264-PublicHD.mkv","mimetype":"video/x-matroska"},{"id":"movie.471","title":"Enemy at the Gates","type":"file","year":2001,"mediatype":"movie","banners":[],"posters":[{"url":"http://radarr.evinyatar.be/api/v3/mediacover/471/poster.jpg?apikey=b52eb9349dd749788b065ee64e4a5168"}],"backdrops":[{"url":"http://radarr.evinyatar.be/api/v3/mediacover/471/fanart.jpg?apikey=b52eb9349dd749788b065ee64e4a5168"}],"dateScanned":"2022-09-13T20:01:11.000Z","releaseDate":"2001-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","overview":"A Russian and a German sniper play a game of cat-and-mouse during the Battle of Stalingrad in WWII.","rating":7.6,"imdbId":"tt0215750","tmdbId":853,"playable":true,"file":"/movies/Enemy at the Gates (2001)/Enemy.at.the.Gates.2001.720p.BluRay.DTS.x264-ESiR.mkv","mimetype":"video/x-matroska"},{"id":"movie.472","title":"Enemy of the State","type":"file","year":1998,"mediatype":"movie","banners":[],"posters":[{"url":"http://radarr.evinyatar.be/api/v3/mediacover/472/poster.jpg?apikey=b52eb9349dd749788b065ee64e4a5168"}],"backdrops":[{"url":"http://radarr.evinyatar.be/api/v3/mediacover/472/fanart.jpg?apikey=b52eb9349dd749788b065ee64e4a5168"}],"dateScanned":"2022-09-13T20:01:12.000Z","releaseDate":"1998-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","overview":"A hotshot Washington criminal lawyer becomes the target of a rogue security executive videotaped in the act of murdering a congressman when the incriminating tape is surreptitiously slipped into his shopping bag by the videographer, who is fleeing the executive's assassins.","rating":7.3,"imdbId":"tt0120660","tmdbId":9798,"playable":true,"file":"/movies/Enemy of the State/Enemy.of.the.State.1998.Blu-ray.1080p.DTS.x264-CtrlHD.mkv","mimetype":"video/x-matroska"},{"id":"movie.473","title":"Enough Said","type":"file","year":2013,"mediatype":"movie","banners":[],"posters":[{"url":"http://radarr.evinyatar.be/api/v3/mediacover/473/poster.jpg?apikey=b52eb9349dd749788b065ee64e4a5168"}],"backdrops":[{"url":"http://radarr.evinyatar.be/api/v3/mediacover/473/fanart.jpg?apikey=b52eb9349dd749788b065ee64e4a5168"}],"dateScanned":"2022-09-13T20:01:13.000Z","releaseDate":"2013-09-19T00:00:00.000Z","overview":"Eva is a divorced soon-to-be empty-nester wondering about her next act.
